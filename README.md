### Inital idea

# Insert Photo of old project here
My original idea (above) i had started coding, but while developing i decided the user interface was messy and uninspired. which pushed me to go back to the drawing board and redevelop how i wanted the website to look and function. my biggest issue was Phone users wasnt in the forefront of my mind, and while coding i realised the website would easily become cluttered and akward to navigate, below are some brief descriptions of issues i had. (will not go into detail as re-development had its own issues)  

* spacing issues with icons
* hover over changes issues
* aligning logo left without changing in nav bar
* reduction of hero image resolutions to fit. (will go into more detail below)

### Final Idea
# insert word wireframes here.
above is the basic function of the website, this is how i wanted the website to flow to each webpage. 
# insert figma screenshots here.
This was my re-design to make the website more user friendly, i also designed how i wanted the website to look on tablet and phone.
